# Wine-Quality-Classification

The dataset contains information on wine from the Vinho Verde region. The dataset contains 12 columns and almost 5000 records. 
We have 11 describing variables and one describing variable - quality (wine quality).  Our task will be to make a prediction of wine quality (as described on the page with the  dataset 0-10) based on descriptor variables such as acidity, pH, density, alcohol and others.
